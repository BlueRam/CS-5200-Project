Defined roasts as: Light, Medium, Dark, Espresso 

Decided to use an R model using posterior probability to predict roast.  

Decided to add a Survey table.  Survey(ID, various demographics....).  

Survey has a relationship to Subscriber.  I think it should also have one to User, but that's an issue for another time.  

The survey collects information on Age, Frequency, Darkness, Gender, and Ethnicity.  

The survery table feeds data into a model that outputs predictions per user that we want to feed into a prediction table.  

Prediction(ID, Prediction (predicting roast)).
