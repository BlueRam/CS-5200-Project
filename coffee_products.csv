3,Pike Place Roast,Medium,11,"From our first store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market to our coffeehouses around the world, customers requested a freshly brewed coffee they could enjoy throughout the day. So in 2008 our master blenders and roasters created it for you, a blend so consistent and harmonious that no single characteristic dominates—or disappears. A smooth, well-rounded blend of Latin American coffees with subtly rich flavors of cocoa and toasted nuts, it’s perfect for every day.",59
4,Breakfast Blend,Medium,11,"We introduced this blend in 1998 for those who prefer a milder cup. A shade lighter than most of our offerings—more toasty than roasty—it was the result of playing with roast and taste profile together for a flavor that appealed to a wider range of palates. Perfect if you want to wake up to a less intense coffee but still want a lot of character, it's lively with a citrusy tang that gives way to a clean finish.",43
5,Veranda Blend,Light,19,"In Latin America, coffee farms are often run by families, with their own homes on the same land where their coffee grows. We’ve sipped coffee with these farmers for decades, sitting on their verandas, overlooking the lush beauty of the coffee trees rolling out in the distance. Most times it was a lightly roasted coffee like this one. It took us more than 80 tries to get it right—mellow and flavorful with a nice softness.",29
6,Costa Rica Latin American Blend,Medium,10,"A paradise of stunning beaches, cascading waterfalls and lush forests—Costa Rica is rich in biodiversity and recognized for cultivating high-quality coffees that flourish on the fertile, volcanic slopes. To balance the vibrant notes and accentuate the brightness Costa Rican coffees contribute, we blended in beans from Latin America, creating this distinctly elegant cup with a soft lemony sweetness and smooth cocoa texture. Suggested food pairing: Lemon Loaf, Chocolate Covered Fruit, Milk Chocolate",81
7,Bright Sky Blend,Light,9,"Wake up to an inviting Latin American coffee that's as mild and welcoming as a gentle sunrise. We've carefully roasted these beans just enough to bring out their nutty flavor and a touch of acidity, culminating in a crisp and pleasant finish.",50
8,Ambrosia Coffee of God,Light,18,"Few coffees deliver the layers of complexity that can be found in Ambrosia Coffee of God, commonly referred to as simply Ambrosia. Fruity notes and caramel sweetness compliment subtle flavors of bergamot and black tea.",25
9,Ether,Dark,18,"Among the darkest blends available at Philz. Appropriately named, this blend is not for the faint of heart. The Ether blend is smooth and well-rounded with an array of smoky tones in the finish.",5
10,Tantalizing Turkish,Dark,18,"Tantalizing Turkish is exceptionally flavorful and unique due to its intensely rich and familiar characteristics of traditional Turkish coffee. This blend is brewed with cardamom at our stores, which can also be ordered online in our ""Teas & Spices"" section.",43
