# CS-5200-Project
Db project.  Working to develop a database populated with fake data to model an online Coffee store with a recommendation engine. 


The Master Repository contains all files, scripts, and datasets that are considered current.  

Anything that isn't current, that's a work in progress and hasn't been approved by other group members, should go into the "feature" branch.
